# Evangelistta7's ChatBot Project

**Overview:**

This repository contains the development files for a simple chatbot application, built using Python and leveraging the OpenAI GPT-4o mini model. The chatbot utilizes the OpenAI API to process user inputs and generate responses. The application features both Jupyter Notebook-based development and a standalone Python application.

**Key Features:**

* **Powered by OpenAI GPT-4o mini:** Provides natural language understanding and response generation.
* **Interactive Chat Interface:** Implemented through a `while` loop, with a "0" input acting as a termination command.
* **Development Flexibility:** Includes Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation and a Python script for deployment.
* **Knowledge Source:** This project was developed based on the knowledge acquired from the Asimov Academy course "Explorando a API da OpenAI."

**Project Structure:**

The project is organized into two primary components:

* **Jupyter Notebooks:**
    * `api_testing_openai.ipynb`: Used for initial API testing.
    * `st_talk_openai.ipynb`: Calling the API for the st time and buling all the functions.
    * `the_chatbot_nb.ipynb`: The core chatbot notebook, containing the main logic and interaction flow.
* **Python Application:**
    * `the_chatbot.py`: A standalone Python script that provides a command-line interface for the chatbot.

**Technical Details:**

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **API Integration:** OpenAI API (GPT-4o mini)
* **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook, Python (command-line)
* **Loop Control:** `while` loop with "0" as the exit condition.

**Usage:**

* For experimentation and development, utilize the provided Jupyter Notebooks.
* To run the standalone application, execute `the_chatbot.py` from the command line.

**Note:**

* Ensure you have the necessary API keys and dependencies installed to run the application.
* This project serves as a demonstration of basic chatbot development using OpenAI's API, and is the result of the knowledge gotten from the Asimov Academy course "Explorando a API da OpenAI".
